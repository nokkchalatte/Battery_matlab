# Battery Cycle Testing MATLAB Scripts

## Description
This repository contains MATLAB scripts designed to analyze battery performance during cycling tests. The scripts focus on three main tests: **Coulomb Efficiency**, **OCV Curve**, and **EIS Impedance**. These tools are intended for battery testing, performance evaluation, and data analysis.

## Features
- **Coulomb Efficiency**: Analyze the charge/discharge efficiency of the battery over several cycles.
- **OCV Curve**: Plot Open Circuit Voltage (OCV) vs. State of Charge (SOC) to estimate battery health.
- **EIS Impedance**: Perform Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) data fitting to study the battery impedance characteristics.
